### Nishi
is a web designer and front-end developer who is passionate about creating beautiful and user-friendly interfaces.

She also enjoys graphic design and music theory, although she doesn't create music herself. 
Nishi struggles with social anxiety, but loves connecting with others online. 
She keeps an idea journal and can often be found doodling or lost in thought when she should be paying attention. 
Beyond a love for all things creative, she is also a huge advocate for social justice.

Talking in third person makes her feel awkward, but she's doing it anyway because it helps with her anxiety for some reason.
